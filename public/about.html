<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi there! I'm Arike Dasaolu, a passionate junior web developer with a year of experience in creating dynamic and user-friendly websites. 
  I specialize in front end development and responsive design.
  
  <p>My journey in web development started about five years ago when i created my first wordpress blog called <a href="https://feranmisthoughts.wordpress.com">Feranmi's Thoughts.</a>
  Since then, I have been dedicated to honing my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field. 
  I love the creative and problem-solving aspects of web development, and I strive to deliver high-quality solutions that meet the unique needs of each project.</p>

<p>Besides my technical skills, I am a lifelong learner who is always eager to expand my knowledge and explore new possibilities. 
  I am an excellent problem solver, detail-oriented, and committed to delivering projects on time and to the client's satisfaction.
  When I'm not coding, you can find me crocheting stuffed animals and clothes and gaming. 
  These activities help me maintain a healthy work-life balance and provide fresh perspectives that I can bring to my web development projects.</p>
